Question 1
After the user clicks the button once, it'll display 1. This is because the setCount function provided by useState does not immediately update the state. Instead, it schedules an update to the component's state, which may be batched together. When clicked twice, it'll batch both into a single update, so it'll only incriment once.

Question 2
In this example the displayed count after clicking Increment will be 2. This is because each call to setCount in the increment function now receives the previous state (prevCount) as an argument. This ensures that the updates to the state are based on the latest state value, rather than a potentially stale state.

Question 3
React's state updates are immutable. The code directly mutates the items array when it calls push.
function ItemList() {
  const [items, setItems] = useState(["apple", "orange"]);

  const addItem = () => {
    const updatedItems = [...items, "banana"]; // Create a new array with the updated items
    setItems(updatedItems); // Update the state with the new array
  }

  return (
    <div>
      {items.map((item, index) => <p key={index}>{item}</p>)}
      <button onClick={addItem}>Add Item</button>
    </div>
  );
}

Question 4
The use of the spread operator (...) in this scenario is necessary to create a new array with the existing items followed by the new item ("banana"). This ensures that the state is updated immutably
